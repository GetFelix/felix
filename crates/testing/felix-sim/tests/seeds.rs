//! Runs whole simulated clusters from a seed.
//!
//! Each run builds three to five real brokers and a control plane in this
//! process, drives clients and a nemesis against them for 120 seconds of
//! virtual time and checks what happened. A failure prints its seed. To run
//! one seed again, with the log the failure printed:
//!
//! ```text
//! FELIX_SIM_SEED=<n> cargo test -p felix-sim --test seeds replay -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! | Variable | Meaning | Default |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `FELIX_SIM_SEED` | the seed `replay` runs | unset: `replay` is skipped |
//! | `FELIX_SIM_SEEDS` | how many seeds `seeds` runs | 4 |
//! | `FELIX_SIM_SEED_START` | the first seed `seeds` runs | 1 |
//! | `RUST_LOG` | broker and harness logs | none |
//!
//! A run is repeatable to the extent described in `felix_sim::run`: the same
//! seed injects the same faults at the same virtual times, but the brokers'
//! own interleaving can differ, so a failure may take more than one replay to
//! show again.
//!
//! A seed that exposed a bug is pinned below with `#[ignore = "#<issue>"]`,
//! and runs with `cargo test -p felix-sim --test seeds -- --ignored`.
